    Collected references on passive Wi-Fi scanning, BLE sniffing, and signal analysis.
    Decided to keep project strictly ![marauder design](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b0c5681d41784e55194f721390fc4dbf9b33b1cd/marauder%20design.jpeg)
passive and educational; documented ethics in README.

Day 2 (BOM & parts selection)

    Surveyed vendors (Amazon, Robu) for ESP32 boards, TFT displays, LiPo, chargers, antenna, buzzer.

    Chose ESP32-DevKitC-32UE for BLE + Wi-Fi dual support and ILI9341 TFT for visualization. Time spent: 10 hours

Day 3 (Mechanical design & 3D case)

    Modeled case layout concept (dimensions, mounting points) in Fusion360 / CAD.
    Exported STL for front/back case and iterated on fastening points and ventilation.
